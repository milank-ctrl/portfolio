# Portfolio

I was thinking what is the best way to show my pet projects and push myself to finish them :smile: so I decided to create a portfolio site.

## Tech
The following techs I am planning to use:
- Python
- HTML, CSS, JS
- React
- Web3

This project is still work in progress but you can check it here: [my portfolio site](https://milank.xyz/)
